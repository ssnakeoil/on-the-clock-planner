# Work Day Planner

## Description

You're busy, it's a tale as old as time! This work day planner lets you add tasks you need to complete on the clock so you can see it all in one place! Each hour is conditionally color coded so that you can view your most urgent tasks due within the hour (red), tasks still yet to be done (green), and tasks that have expired (gray).

This app uses Day.js to grab the current time from your machine.

## Installation
